# Pipeline for Copy Number Variant Detection in Targeted Sequencing
Development of a pipeline for Copy Number Variant detection in targeted sequencing

This repository contains the pipeline developed as part of a master’s thesis focused on detecting copy number variants (CNVs) from targeted NGS data. The workflow integrates five open-source tools (DECoN, CODEX2, CoNVaDING, panelcn.MOPS and ClinCNV) into a unified framework for CNV calling and annotation.

Once implemented, the pipeline was applied to a Parkinson’s disease cohort to assess its performance and explore its potential for genetic characterization.
